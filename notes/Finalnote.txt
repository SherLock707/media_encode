psy-rd 1 to 2 (more complex/action packed/detailed anime = higher value needed, also increases bitrate)

aq-strength 0.6 to 1 (more complex/detailed = need higher value, don't go beyond 1 as you may introduce ringing artifacts. You will mostly use 0.8-1. Also raises bitrate.)

deblock -1:-1 to 1:1 (depends on source, leave on 0:0 if you don't know what to use) and 

bframes 4 to 8 (I highly recommend 6, 8 if possible. Encode penalty is only ~5% going from 4 to 8).

if your source has grain, psy-rdoq should be raised from the default 1 to 3-5 depending on source (note: only combine higher rdoq with crf<18 and no-sao, or you'll end up with grain "blocks" instead of grain "grain").

Use limit-sao for crf 17-19. Use no-sao for crf<18 if there are fine grain present. Else leave on default.

Use no-strong-intra-smoothing only for crf<16. This helps preserve fine details. High crf will result in blocking due to lack of smoothing on 32x32 blocks.
